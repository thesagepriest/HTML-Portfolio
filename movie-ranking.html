    <h2>My Top 5 Movies</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>The Old Guard</h3>
        </li>
        <p>This movie happens to be my favourite, because it reminds me of the fragility of man and it shows how much we
            try to fight against it. It is based on the graphic novel by Greg Rucka and Leandro Fern√°ndez.</p>
        <li>
            <h3>Overdrive</h3>
        </li>
        <p>This one is high up there with my faves, almost zero to no nudity, and a peak movie for car enthusiasts. And
            the handle on misdirection and hacking with C++ and Assembly language pretty much got me hooked. Its not
            like those fake hackers Hollywood plot.</p>
        <li>
            <h3>Tron Legacy</h3>
        </li>
        <p>I really don't remember much about this one, because I pretty much watched it as a child and it did kinda
            leave a lasting impact on my. I really look forward to watching it again some time soon.</p>
        <li>
            <h3>Too Big To Fail</h3>
        </li>
        <p>If you are looking to get an inside story into how the crash of 08 happened, this is pretty much one of the
            best movies that lets you in on it. From the uncanny careless attitude of the US financial regulatory
            service to the US Government pretty much backing the crash of 08 and making the current big banks of the
            world almost invisible, this is a must watch for intellects looking to see how the banks got it wrong and
            how the government pretty much saved them.</p>
        <li>
            <h3>The Big Short</h3>
        </li>
        <p>Another great insight into the financial crisis of 08, this movie featuring Christian Bale as Micheal Burry
            "the central character" is a banger. From being the first recorded finder of the housing bubble, to warning
            the authorities about it without getting a positive result, to being one of the traders to short the housing
            marketand later getting subpoenaed by congress, this is such a great watch and it does tell how much doing
            due research into any investment does actually pay off.</p>
    </ul>

    <h2>My Top 5 Animes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>The Naruto Series</h3>
        </li>
        <p>Pretty much one of the most popular animes of all time and one of the big three of anime, The Naruto series
            follows the story of a young, baseless outcast shinobi with a dream of becoming hokage "the strongest
            shinobi ever". This is a story of how much hard work pays off and how much the opinion of people about a
            person can chnage with regards to their growth. This is probably my favourite anime of all time.</p>
        <li>
            <h3>The Promised Neverland</h3>
        </li>
        <p>It follows the story of three orphaned children "Emma, Ray and Norman" and their siblings and how they try to
            escape from thier home/prison. If you like plot twists and psychologically draining movies, then this is a
            must watch for you.</p>
        <li>
            <h3>Solo Levelling</h3>
        </li>
        <p>If you like from zero to hero troupes, then you should definitely see this one. The best anime of 2024, it
            follows the story of Sun Jinwoo a young korean F-class hunter who becomes the strongest hunter in the world
            following a near death experience.</p>
        <li>
            <h3>Kaiju No 8</h3>
        </li>
        <p>What happens when you become the very monster you hate and hunt? Find out in this intriguing story of middle
            aged young man Kafka Hibino. From being a failure who couldn't get into the Anti Kaiju Defense Force to
            becoming a Kaiju and passing the AKDF exams, watch Kafka become an old man in a field of young people to
            eventually saving the world. If you believe in chasing your dreams no matter what age you are regardless of
            what people think or say, then you join in the cheer for Kafka Hibino</p>
        <li>
            <h3>Rezero:Starting Life In Another World From Zero</h3>
        </li>
        <p>What woyld you do if you suddenly found yourself in mediveal times where magic and mythic creatures are a
            thing? Subaru decides to help an elfen princess become queen of the woman race. Watch him grow from absolute
            trash with a resolve to an absolute hero. If you like isekais that stress your mind, you should definitely
            look this one up.</p>
